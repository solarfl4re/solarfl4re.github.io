<h3>David Lane</h3>

<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I&#39;m a Russian major at UAA. I love learning new things, helping people, and solving provlems. I enjoy photography, reading, and hiking.</p>

<h3>Learning:</h3>

<p>Python, Haskell (Very basic level), (Arch) Linux setup and administration, Shell tools and scripting.
Comfortable with Windows, Linux, OS X, Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, VIM, Version control (git), and more.</p>

<h3>Helping people:</h3>

<p>I run a home network with using the firewall/router platform pfSense and fix things when they break, manage access to the internet (filtering, traffic shaping), and respond to support requests from users.</p>

<h3>Solving problems:</h3>

<p>Using Python, I wrote a program that checks the library accounts of multiple users, attempts to renew items that will be due soon, and sends emails listing renewed and not-renewed items.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>UAA Russian Tutor 2013-Present</p>

<p>I give students the one-on-one time that they can&#39;t get it in class, working on difficult topics (grammar, pronounciation, confusing differences between the languages). I&#39;ve seen students become more confident as they are encouraged to make mistakes (and then learn the correct way), be creative, and take ownership of the language and make it theirs.</p></li>
<li><p>Fort Richardson Library, &hellip; 2008-2009</p>

<p>In addition to common library duties (cataloging, checking out, and shelving books) I helped many people in our computer labs. This positive experience, in addition to the already excellent service, made them more likely to come back. I also identified a bottleneck in our system to add books, and automated the repetitive parts; this was well recieved, and saved time.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>University of Alaska Anchorage   2009-Present
Bachelor&#39;s in Russian, GPA 3.6</p>

<ul>
<li>Dean&#39;s list &hellip;.(put the date)</li>
<li>Placed 3rd in the local ACTR Russian essay contest (date)</li>
</ul>
